To fix the issue, remove any extra spaces within the `calc()` expression. The correct code should be:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
}
```

This version correctly performs the calculation by removing the space after the minus operator, ensuring that the browser correctly interprets the subtraction.  Always maintain proper spacing within your `calc()` expressions to avoid these types of issues.
