This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue with the CSS `calc()` function: inconsistent spacing within the calculation can lead to unexpected results across different browsers. The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.  Ensure that there are no unnecessary spaces between operators and operands to ensure consistent and correct calculation results.
