The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there can be unexpected behavior if spaces are not handled correctly within the calculation. For example, the following code will cause issues: 

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 20px );
}
```

The space after `-20px` will result in an invalid calculation in some browsers.  This happens because the parser may interpret it as two separate tokens instead of a single subtraction operation.
